## 🚀 All-in-One Search for Coding Problems

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve built a platform that simplifies the searching of coding practice problems across various platforms.

## 🌟 What It Does
This platform allows users to search data structures and algorithms problems across multiple platforms (like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.). Instead of jumping from one platform to another, you can search by problem name and find out how many platforms feature that problem, helping you practice efficiently.

## 🔍 How It Works
- **Unified Search:** Enter a problem name, and the platform will show which platforms offer that problem or similar ones.
- **Quick Navigation:** Click on a problem, and you'll be taken to the respective platform to solve it right away.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)
- **UI Library:** NextUI
- **Data Handling:** Web scraping for fetching problem data across multiple platforms
- **Search Engine:** Fuse.js for fast, fuzzy matching of problem names
- **Hosting:** Vercel for seamless deployment

## 🔧 Local Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: v16+)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm

### 🛠 Steps to Run Locally

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/karthiksriramoju/search-project.git
 cd search-project
```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies**
```sh
 npm install
```

3️⃣ **Run the development server**
```sh
 npm run dev
```
This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.
